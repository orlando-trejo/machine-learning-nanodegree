# machine-learning-nanodegree
This repository contains class assignments and projects from my completed Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree.

The following projects were worked on during the Nanodegree:

### Project 0 - Titanic Survival Exploration

In this project the goal was to predict whether a passenger survived given 
information about sex, age, class, ticket price, family members, and embarking location. At first, no 
machine learning algorithm is used to make the predictions resulting on an accuracy of about 80% on the training set.
However, when using ML models like Random Forest and Support Vector Classifiers, it was possible to boost accuracy on
the training set above 95%. By comparing it with performance from a top Kaggle entry, the accuracy expected on the test
set is around 80%. This is further validated by also doing a cross validation score analysis on the training set.
