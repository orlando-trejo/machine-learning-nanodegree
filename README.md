# machine-learning-nanodegree
This repository contains class assignments and projects from my completed Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree.

The following projects were worked on during the Nanodegree:

### Project 0 - Titanic Survival Exploration

In this project the goal was to predict whether a passenger survived given 
information about sex, age, class, ticket price, family members, and embarking location. At first, no 
machine learning algorithm is used to make the predictions resulting on an accuracy of about 80% on the training set.
However, when using ML models like Random Forest and Support Vector Classifiers, it was possible to boost accuracy on
the training set above 95%. By comparing it with performance from a top Kaggle entry, the accuracy expected on the test
set is around 80%. This is further validated by also doing a cross validation score analysis on the training set. 

### Project 1 - Predicting Boston Housing Prices

This is the first official project for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. The goal is to predict the housing prices
in Boston. The first part of the project is downloading and exploring the dataset. From a correlation map it is clear that
the percentage of the lower status has the strongest negative correlation with housing prices. After optimizing and
fitting a Decision Tree Regressor, two other key parameters are identified: the average number of rooms and the weighted
distances from employment centers in Boston. The next part of the notebook digs into how to systematically develop the model
and track the performance as a function of the max_depth parameter in the Regressor. Finally, a housing price is predicted
for a pre-determined client.
