This is the first official project for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. The goal is to predict the housing prices
in Boston. The first part of the project is downloading and exploring the dataset. From a correlation map it is clear that
the percentage of the lower status has the strongest negative correlation with housing prices. After optimizing and 
fitting a Decision Tree Regressor, two other key parameters are identified: the average number of rooms and the weighted
distances from employment centers in Boston. The next part of the notebook digs into how to systematically develop the model
and track the performance as a function of the max_depth parameter in the Regressor. Finally, a housing price is predicted
for a pre-determined client.
