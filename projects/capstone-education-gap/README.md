Udacity Capstone Project: Predicting Educational Achievement Gaps
Version 1.0 02/19/2017

GENERAL USAGE NOTES
-------------------

-	The project folder contains the raw datasets for covariates and 
	achievement gaps, along with the codebooks for each.

-	The restructured gaps dataset is also in the folder to avoid
	the long time to run the part of the code in the notebook to creat it. File name is 'df_gaps.csv'

-	The notebook is written to read the data files by name in the same
	folder. 

-	Going through the notebook and hitting shift+enter should yield the 	same results reported in the project.

- 	The main libraries used in this project are from sklearn importing
	the necessary functions to run Decision Tree models, Logistic 
	Regression, Suppor Vector Machines, and scoring functions.

-	Other libraries consist of pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scipy.

- 	The notebook file is designed to run locally in the folder 
	containing the data files and subset of covariate labels.
