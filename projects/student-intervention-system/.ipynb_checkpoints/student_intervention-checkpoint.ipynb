    "Based on preliminary classifier comparisons with default settings, using SVC results in a better model for predicting a student passing her final exam. Across different training set sizes (100, 200, and 300 students) SVC outperformed Logistic Regression and GaussianNB in the training and test sets. Given the available data set, the slight increased computational cost of using SVC does not offset its overall increase in the training and test F1 scores.\n",

    "In this case, LogisticRegression outperformed GaussianNB on the test set which suggests that the former generalizes better to the given data set. Similarly, on test sets SVC outperforms LogisticRegression with training set sizes of 100 and 200 and matches performance with training size of 300. This suggest that non-linear decision boundaries likely exist and are more pronounced with smaller training sets. Therefore, a tuned SVC is a proper model for this data set."

Typically, testing is done with about 75% of the data set and training with the remaing portion. It is important to randomize the data selection in order to optimize the algorithm's prediction validity. An adquate classification boundary is found when the SVM algorithm has maximized and converged predictive performance on the randomized training and test sets.
